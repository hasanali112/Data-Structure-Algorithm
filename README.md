## Module 1: Time and space complexity

### Learning topics:

1. Why use time complexity? -- to make code efficient
2. What is time complexity? -- How many steps or operations are in this code
3. How to calculate time complexity?- Omega, theta and Big O notation
4. Linear complexity - O(n) -- for loop increament and decrement part using + -;
5. Logarithmic complexity - O(logN) -- for loop increament and decrement part using \* /;
